    PluginSelector:
      description: >-
        Used for selecting plugins. For example, a selector that provides the
        value of a drug class informs what type of guidance plugin is required,
        or an URL to a FHIR server informs FHIR server/mapper plugin combination
        to use.
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The client should have prior knowledge of the full list of selectors
            available with this version of the mapper. This id is used to
            determine which selector type is described.
          example: FHIR.URI
        legalValues:
          type: object
          description: >-
            If absent, all values are legal, so treat the value like a string.
            Use the JSON schema,
            https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html.
            For example, { type: 'string', 'enum': [ 'Gentamicin', 'Amikacin' ]
            } to define an enumeration,  { 'type': 'number' } for a float, and {
            'type': 'number', 'minimum': '0' } for a positive number, and {
            'type': 'integer' } for an integer. Furthermore, a non-standard
            'title' can be added in support of a human-readable string for the
            type's value. This maybe be implemented by the PDS to aid in
            debugging, however clients should not depend on this value. NOTE:
            This value is actually an object type, but we use 'string' here to
            overcome a shortcoming of the swagger ui. This design choice was
            made in order to prioritize a better interactive documentation
            experience for the API user.
          example:
            type: string
            enum:
              - value: 'urn://cdwh.nctracs.v1'
                title: NCTraCS Carolina Data Warehouse
              - value: 'http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4'
              - value: 'https://open-ic.epic.com/FHIR/api/FHIR/DSTU2'
        selectorValue:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Unique identifier for this type. Stylistically, community standard
            coding system used for this type will preface the code used, e.g.,
            http://fhir.org or urn://cdwh.nctracs.v1. The title in the example
            is optional. NOTE: This value is actually an object type, but we use
            'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of the swagger ui. This
            design choice was made in order to prioritize a better interactive
            documentation experience for the API user. 
          example:
            value: 'http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4'
            title: Hapi FHIR base URL
        title:
          type: string
          example: FHIR URI - an URL (locator) or an URN (unique name)
          description: Human-readable name for this selector type.
