        This schema mirrors the 'Log' schema from tx-logging (see
        github.com/RENCI/tx-logging).
      type: object
      required:
        - timestamp
        - event
        - source
        - level
      properties:
        '-id':
          not: {}
        timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          example: '2019-09-20T00:00:00Z'
        event:
          type: string
          example: >-
            The specified mapper (pdspi-mapper-example) is not compatible with
            the specified FHIR server (pdspi-fhir-hapi).
        source:
          type: string
          example: admin user
        level:
          description: >-
            The level value mirrors syslog values, as follows: 1 - alert,
            'immediate action is needed' : e.g., the data will be returned, but
            PDS picked a mapper/server at random because no default was
            selected; 2 - critical: this could indicate resources are nearing
            full, or similar; 3 - error: something unexpected happened, PDS
            tried to correct for it, but the admin should be alerted; 4 -
            warning: PDS had to correct something unexpectedly but all is well;
            5 - notification, 'Normal but significant condition': a dashboard
            might chose to render this message in a special console box; 6 -
            informational: same as above, but for auditing; 7 - debugging: maybe
            the dashboard has an optional debugging console box for handling
            debug messages.
          type: integer
          enum:
            - 1
            - 2
            - 3
            - 4
            - 5
            - 6
            - 7
          example: 1
        action:
          type: string
          example: >-
            Arbitrarily chose this FHIR server from those available:
            (pdspi-fhir-example). Only one FHIR server is available that is also
            compatible with pdspi-mapper-example
