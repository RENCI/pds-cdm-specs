            A string, uniquely identifies the enabled and installed plugin in
            this deployment, used to identify this plugin in realtime for
            retriving guidance. Note the dashboard client only needs access to
            patient variables required by the installed/enabled plugins, and the
            guidance plugin data access is restricted even further to only what
            is neeed for guidance based on the selectors (need-to-know access to
            patient data).
