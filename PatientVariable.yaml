    PatientVariable:
      description: >-
        Used to specify EHR patient values as well as user-supplied overrides of
        those EHR values, and/or user-supplied replacements for values missing
        in the EHR.
      type: object
      required:
        - id
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The id for one of the patient variables supported by this PDS
            version. The client has the option of ignoring this variable if it
            doesn't recognize the id, but if another plugin requires this variable, 
            then the user won't have the option of overriding it if the client ignores it.
          example: 'LOINC:30525-0'
        certitude:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The certitude of the value, 0 not certain, 1 somewhat certain, 2
            certain. User-supplied values will always be '2' to avoid personal 
            bias in reporting certitude, with the assumption that human error 
            will be intercepted, and human intelligence overrides algorithm outputs.
          example: 2
        variableDescription:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Description of the patient variable can optionally be set by the plugin. Patient
            variable descriptions should describe the variable precisely; for
            example, rather than say simply 'BMI',the variable might be
            described as 'nearest BMI prior to intervention', or
            'comma-delimited list of {BMI,date} objects for the patient with a
            given study period, as defined by the 'study-start', 'study-end'
            model parameters'. The comprehensive list of supported patient variables is tied to
            the PDS release. 
          example: "The age is determined by subtracting the birthdate from the current time. Also known as 'chronological age' or 'Post Natal Age' (PNA). Specified as somen fraction of years, convention."
        how:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A value of 'The value was specified by the end user.' indicates
            that the EHR value (whether or not it was missing in the EHR)
            has been overriden by the client.
          example: The value was specified by the end user.
        title:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A non-standardized, human-readable string to describe the id. May be
            implemented by the PDS to aid in debugging, clients should not
            depend on this value.
          example: Age
        variableValue:
          description: >-
            The type for the variableValue is defined by the legalValues, and thus is
            the client informed on how to render the variableValue. The
            variableValue may also include the 'units' field, which is optional,
            and if left off, implies the system default units. It's up to the
            guidance plugin to make unit conversions as needed by the guidance
            model, just as it is up to the dashboard to make unit conversions as
            needed by the end user. NOTE: The 'variableValue' is actually an object 
            type, but we use 'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of the swagger 
            ui. This design choice was made in order to prioritize a better 
            interactive documentation experience for the API user.
          type: object
          example:
            value: '0.5'
            units: years
        why:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Provides the client with a human-readable, non-standard
            justification for why the plugin needs this particular variable.
            This can be rendered by the client to provide the end-user with
            rationale for the patient values, but does not address how the value
            was computed.
          example: >-
            Age is used to calculate the creatinine clearance. Dosing is lower
            for geriatric patient and contraindicated for pediatric patients
        legalValues:
          type: string
          description: >-
            If absent, all values are legal, so treat the value like a string.
            Use the JSON schema,
            https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html.
            For example, { type: 'string', 'enum': [ 'Gentamicin', 'Amikacin' ]
            } to define an enumeration,  { 'type': 'number' } for a float, and {
            'type': 'number', 'minimum': '0' } for a positive number, and {
            'type': 'integer' } for an integer. NOTE: This value is
            actually an object type, but we use 'string' here to overcome a
            shortcoming of the swagger ui. This design choice was made in order
            to prioritize a better interactive documentation experience for the
            API user. 
          example:
            type: number
            minimum: '0'
        timestamp:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The time used to compute the patient variable. For example, this could be the current time if a patient is presenting for treatment, or in a retrospective study, it could be an intervention date, or any date within the retrospective study timeframe.
          format: date-time
          example: "2020-07-01T14:29:15.453Z"
