    PluginParameter:
      type: object
      required:
        - id
        - parameterValue
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The id for one of the parameters used by the plugin in question.
            Parameters are completely defined by the plugin and need not be
            interchangable with other plugins. The client will have no prior
            knowledge for plugin parameters.
          example: 'pdspi-guidance-example:1'
        title:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A non-standardized, human-readable string to describe the id. May be
            implemented by the PDS to aid in debugging, clients should not
            depend on this value.
          example: Extended interval nomogram
        parameterDescription:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Description provided by the plugin. The plugin, not the client, is
            therefore responsible for converting the descriptions to the
            appropriate language based on internationalization and
            personalization preferences.
          example: >-
            This calculator uses one of four extended-interval nomograms. Please
            choose one nomogram.
        parameterValue:
          type: object
          description: >-
            The actual value of the parameter. Used to pass the plugin's factory
            defaults, admin over-rides, user over-rides, or the actual values
            used by the plugin. NOTE: This value is actually an object type, but
            we use 'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of the swagger ui.
            This design choice was made in order to prioritize a better
            interactive documentation experience for the API user.
          example:
            value: Hartford
        legalValues:
          type: object
          description: >-
            The 'legalValues' will always be present in the '/config' endpoint
            response and need not be provided to or from the client in the
            '/guidance' endpoint call. Use the JSON schema,
            https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html.
            For example, { type: 'string', 'enum': [ 'Gentamicin', 'Amikacin' ]
            } to define an enumeration,  { 'type': 'number' } for a float, and {
            'type': 'number', 'minimum': '0' } for a positive number, and {
            'type': 'integer' } for an integer. NOTE: This value is actually an
            object type, but we use 'string' here to overcome a shortcoming of
            the swagger ui. This design choice was made in order to prioritize a
            better interactive documentation experience for the API user. 
          example:
            type: string
            enum:
              - Hartford
              - Urban-Craig
              - Conventional A
              - Conventional B
